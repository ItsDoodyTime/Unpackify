## ⚠️ WARNING! ⚠️
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE make sure you TRUST the authors of the archived files you're about to extract with my software.<br>This software does NOT do any malware checks before extracting, and it does not have any safety-locks. - So, please make sure the files you're extracting are SAFE!!!!<br><br>

## Why does this exist?
- I originally created it for my own needs, being unzipping and unpacking multiple mod files for games at once without having to go through the tedious process of unzipping them one by one.
- You might ask why since similar programs already exist and do a lot more than just what this software was programmed to do, and to answer your question is because I want to learn and because it's more fun to make things yourself!<br><br>

I decided to share it with others if it helps to solve their issues as well.
